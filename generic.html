									<h1>My name is Terry<br />
									and I like to make games</h1>
									<p>I started playing games when I was about the age of that little monkey on my back in the photo below. Since then I always dreamed of someday creating them for others to enjoy.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Before I decided to return to school to study game programming, I worked all over Canada in several different industries. At the age of 10, on the weekends I would sweep a parking lot at a convienience store my grandmother managed so she wouldnt have to. In my early 20's I left Nova Scotia to work in the NWT at Ekati, Canada's first diamond mine. I worked as an underground miner there for almost 7 years.
								   I eventually left the deep dungeon and<br />did a complete 180 to work as a financial services manager in a luxury car dealership. Some of my experinces working were better than others but all taught me valuble lessons about how to work hard and how to work with others effectvely.</p>
								<p>Eventually I grew tired of sales and at that time in my life my girlfriend was pregnant with my now 3 year old daughter. I decided to leave sales and return to school to finally study something that was going to challenge me but more importantly to learn something I always dreamed of learning. I havent looked back since and am very excited to see what the future brings to me in this exciting industry.</p>
